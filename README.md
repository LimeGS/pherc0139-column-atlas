# PHerc 0139: the columns, in reading order

**Every segmented column of PHerc 0139 (Philodemus, On Gods, book 8) as
plates in physical reading order — all 38 segments (37 body wraps + the
title): 33 with no published readings at all, 4 with isolated phrase-level
readings published in the paper's supplement, and the already-read title
column as a control. Built entirely from public data: the official ds8 ink
maps and the public segment meshes.**

What is formally published on PHerc 0139 (arXiv 2606.29085, 2026-06-25):
the end title ("Φιλοδήμου περὶ θεῶν Η") and, in Supplementary Fig. 1
("Readings from PHerc. 139"), five isolated phrase readings located by
wrap: w49 χωρὶϲ προνο[ί]α̣ϲ̣, w25 ἀόρατα, w34 καὶ τὸ κατ̣ὰ̣ φύϲιν,
w47 καὶ πάν̣τ̣α̣ χωρὶϲ πόνων, w49(int) νοερόν. No continuous transcription
of any column has been published. Everything in these plates beyond the
title and those five phrases is, as of 2026-07-13, unpublished territory —
and the five located phrases double as anchor points to align this series
against the official reading.

## How the reading order was obtained

### 1. Wrap order = mesh geometry, not file names

Every segment's TIFXYZ mesh (x/y/z.tif point map, public bucket) references
the same CT volume (20260102150214, 2.399 µm), so all coordinates are
directly comparable. We fit the scroll axis (first principal component of
the union of all segment point clouds, ~760k subsampled points) and
computed, per segment, the **mean radial distance of its point cloud to
that axis** — the wrap radius.

Result: **Spearman rho = 0.9993 (p = 2e-51)** between the wNNN number in
the segment names and the measured radius. The numbering IS the physical
radial order: w023 innermost (r = 7.02 mm) to w059 outermost (13.26 mm),
all 37 wraps consecutive with no gaps, and the mean radial step between
consecutive wraps is **~0.17 mm — the thickness of rolled papyrus**, an
independent physical sanity check.

> segment's *centroid* is useless here. Each segment is a full turn, so

Herculaneum scrolls are read unrolling outer → inner (the end of the work,
with the subscriptio, is rolled innermost). So reading order is
w059 → w023. The title lands at r = 5.50 mm — **inside** the innermost
body wrap — exactly where a subscriptio should be. (Caveat: the title
mesh sits ~4-5 cm away along the axis from the body wraps — a physically
separate chunk in the same scanned volume — so its radius is indicative,
not as rigorous as the body monotonicity.)

### 2. One wrap ≈ one column

At these radii the circumference of one turn is 2πr = 46-83 mm — roughly
the width of one Herculaneum column. Measured plate widths track 2πr wrap
by wrap (e.g. w059: 87.7 mm map vs 83.3 mm circumference; w024: 58.0 vs
45.7, constant margin). **Each segment map is already an unrolled
column** — no stitching across segments needed.

### 3. Reading direction within a plate

Two independent checks (evidence in `data/direction_check/`):

- **Line continuity**: strips cut across contiguous review windows show
  text lines running horizontally and continuously across the full plate
  width (w047 band y=546, 1911 px through 6 windows without a seam;
  w043 band y=1904, 1610 px).
- **No mirroring**: asymmetric letterforms (lunate epsilon/sigma opening
  RIGHT) in the top-scoring windows, plus the decisive convention anchor:
  the title was officially read from this same render family — a mirrored
  family would not read.

Non-mirrored + lines along x ⇒ the greek runs left → right ⇒ within-plate
reading order is x ascending. The exact wrap-to-wrap seam position (where
one turn's text ends and the next begins) is not modeled; it does not
affect the relative order of anything shown.

### 4. The plates (three styles)

Three renderings of each column, toggled in the viewer:

- **`plates/` — pure ink maps.** The official ds8 ink-detection maps
  (~18 µm/px), contrast-stretched to the 2-98 percentile band, ink white
  on black. Nothing else: no denoising, no content edits, no resampling.
  The viewer overlays amber boxes on the reviewed windows; the PNGs are
  clean.
- **`plates_photo/` — our publication-style composite.** Papyrus texture
  from the CT surface volume (the segment's `surface-volumes` zarr,
  level-3 multiscale, mid-depth layer) as a light background, with the ink
  prediction composited in BLACK on top
  (`out = paper_texture * (1 - 0.88 * ink)`). This is our own approximation,
  in the visual spirit of the paper's Fig. 4 panel b ("ink-enhanced signal
  shown in black against the papyrus texture") — letters read as lines of
  text rather than white blobs — but **not** a byte-verified match to the
  paper's own renderer: no formula for that figure is published.
- **`plates_villa/` — the verified villa recipe.** Same papyrus base, but
  the ink is composited with the actual ink-bake formula from
  ScrollPrize/villa's `foundation/scroll-unwrap-pipeline`
  (`docs/RENDER-STYLE.md` + `configs/global.yaml [ink]`, confirmed
  byte-for-byte 2026-07-13): `opacity = smoothstep(ink, 0.42, 0.78) * 0.88`,
  composited as `tint*opacity + paper*(1-opacity)` with a neutral carbon-black
  tint `(16,16,16)` / `#101010`, no glow. That pipeline composites onto its
  own mesh-rendered RGBA texture, which isn't available here, so this still
  uses our same zarr-slice papyrus as the base — the *ink formula* is
  verified, the *base texture* is still an approximation.

  The texture is fetched with HTTP Range requests over the raw
  (uncompressed, `compressor: null`) zarr chunks so only the three mid
  layers of each chunk are downloaded, not the whole volume. Regenerate
  `plates_photo/` and `plates_villa/` together with
  `scripts/make_photo_plates.py`, which fetches the official ds8 maps and
  the textures from the public bucket once and composites both recipes
  from the same fetch.

## Human review behind the amber boxes

The windows come from a legibility index over the official maps
(proxy classifier → human review of every flagged window, one by one),
across two score bands:

- **score ≥ 0.9:** 63 windows flagged, **54 rated "clear text"** (52 outside
  the title); the 52 body windows were then re-reviewed *in physical reading
  order* with 6 visual filters each, **52/52 confirmed legible**
  (`data/atlas_readthrough.json`; raw review in `data/review_0139_human.json`).
- **relaxed 0.6 ≤ score < 0.9:** the 0.9 cut turned out to be very
  conservative, so all 73 windows in this band were reviewed the same way
  (`data/review_band_0139.json`): **53 clear / 19 uncertain / 1 noise** — a
  single false positive in the whole band, i.e. the sub-0.9 signal was mostly
  real text the threshold was discarding.

Together: **107 windows confirmed legible across 16 body columns plus the
title** (up from 14 body columns at ≥0.9; the relaxed pass added the first
confirmed text on w040 and w048). Single reviewer, no inter-rater check;
"legible" means letterforms a reader could attempt — **it is not a
transcription**.

Ordering is by wrap number (= the physical radial order, ρ=0.9993); the
radius column is the measured per-wrap value, whose sub-0.17 mm scatter
produces a couple of local inversions (e.g. w050 vs w049). Human review so
far covers 22 of the 38 wraps: 17 with confirmed legible windows (16 body
columns plus the title control), and 5 more looked at but with no window
clear enough to confirm (w023/w027/w031/w032/w033). The other 16 are shown
but **not yet reviewed** — their plates are included so the whole segmented
scroll can be read in order. The densest confirmed text sits mid-band
(w043-w047: 54 of the 107 confirmed windows).

## How much of the scroll is this?

These 38 plates are **everything publicly segmented on PHerc 0139**: 38
segments, 1,529 cm2 of mesh, ~2.4 m of papyrus by sum of 2*pi*r — 100% of
what is segmented so far. (An earlier cut of this atlas showed only the 15
human-reviewed wraps, 584 cm2 / ~40% of this; the plates now cover the full
segmented set, reviewed or not.)

Against the whole scroll (estimate, assumptions explicit): the scanned
volume is 184.6 mm along the axis and 63.6 mm across. With an outer radius
of 25-30 mm, a core of 3-5 mm and the measured 0.17 mm/wrap step, the
scroll holds roughly 118-159 wraps and 11-16 m of papyrus. These plates
are then **~15-22% of the papyrus length, and ~5-8% of the total
surface**.

One more honest number: the segments only span a **52 mm axial band of the
184.6 mm volume (~28% of the axis)**. If papyrus occupies the full axis,
these plates show a horizontal band of taller columns, with text above and
below what is segmented today. In other words: most of this scroll,
including more of these same wraps, is still waiting for segmentation.

## Two open asks (for papyrologist eyes)

1. Is any of this actually readable at ds8 resolution?
2. The paper's Supplementary Fig. 1 publishes five phrase readings WITH
   wrap locations (w25, w34, w47, w49) and images at 5 mm scale. All four
   wraps are plates in this atlas (13, 12, 05, 04). Matching those five
   published snippets to exact coordinates in our plates would anchor the
   whole series, pixel-level, against the official reading.

## Honest limits

- We flag and order; we do not read greek. No transcription is claimed.
- Four of the 37 body plates (w025, w034, w047, w049) contain the
  five isolated phrases read in the paper's supplement; they are labeled
  in the viewer. The other 33 body plates have no published readings we
  could locate (checked against the paper incl. supplement,
  scrollprize.org and community repos, 2026-07-13).
- Single reviewer for the window labels.
- ds8 resolution (~18 µm/px): letters are 80-220 px tall — visible, but a
  serious reading attempt may want the full-resolution renders.
- **The amber boxes undercount the text — by design.** They mark only the
  107 one-cm windows a human confirmed as clear text (54 from the >=0.9 band,
  53 from the relaxed 0.6-0.9 pass), out of ~4,900 gridded windows on these
  segments. The index is precision-oriented triage; the plates visibly
  contain far more text than the flagged spots (faint or partial text dilutes
  inside a 1 cm window and scores low — which is exactly why relaxing the
  threshold recovered 53 more with only one false positive). Boxes mean
  "guaranteed", not "all there is".
- This is triage/presentation of official model output, not a new ink
  detector. Whatever the official maps miss, these plates miss.
- Perishable: the official team is actively scaling transcription
  (PHerc 1667 fully read, 2026-06). This ordering is useful today.
