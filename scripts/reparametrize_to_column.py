"""Re-parametrize an arbitrary mesh region into a 'column' image: one axis is
physical arc-length (circumference direction) at roughly fixed radius, the
other is axial position along the scroll -- the same convention the official
wNNN segments already have built in.

STATUS (2026-07-13): validated pieces + one confirmed, unsolved limitation.
Run `--self-test` to see the full finding. In short: isolating "one physical
wrap" via a narrow RADIUS THRESHOLD does not work, even on the official,
known-good w043 segment -- verified directly on its native mesh grid (no
remapping involved): a 2.0mm-wide band only densely fills 35% of its own
bounding box, a 1.0mm band 19%, a 0.6mm band 12.5%. Fill gets WORSE as the
band narrows, the opposite of a resolution/sampling artifact -- it means the
papyrus genuinely undulates in radius by MORE than 2mm within a single
official wrap (real physical rippling of carbonized papyrus, not a bug).
A radius threshold was never a sound way to separate wraps; multi-wrap
grown patches (see data/index_s5_0139/vc_grow_pilot_20260713/) just made the
consequence visible first. The likely-correct fix is continuity-based
separation (native-grid adjacency + a local discontinuity/coherence check,
close to the original VC3D grow pilot's Gate C) rather than a radius cut --
that is unfinished work, do not attempt to patch around it with parameters.

WHAT IS VALIDATED AND REUSABLE:
  - load_axis/perpendicular_frame/point_coords: correct scroll-relative
    (r, theta, along) for any point cloud, reusing the same axis/origin as
    the rest of this project (wrap_radial.json).
  - Native-grid connected-component isolation: separates physically
    distinct surface crossings using TRUE mesh adjacency (which original
    tifxyz row/col a point came from), not 3D distance -- 3D-distance-only
    methods wrongly merge disconnected folds/crossings that happen to sit
    at a similar radius.
  - griddata-based scattered-point-to-grid interpolation with a
    nearest-point distance cutoff (does not invent data across real gaps).
These are genuinely useful for future segmentation work on any wrap/scroll;
the radius-band assumption built on top of them is what does not hold.

METHOD as implemented (radius-band cylindrical projection): for a single
mesh point, define
  r     = perpendicular distance to the scroll axis (already used everywhere
          in this project, see wrap_order.py)
  theta = angle around the axis, in a FIXED reference frame (e0, e1)
  along = position along the axis
then grid (theta*r_mean, along) within one narrow radius band. This produces
a geometrically sane, correctly-labeled image (circumference/axial extent
match physical expectations), but with real, resolution-independent gaps
from the undulation described above -- treat any output as a partial,
patchy view of that radius band, not a complete column.

Usage:
    python scripts/reparametrize_to_column.py --self-test
        # validates against the OFFICIAL w043 segment (known-good, already
        # column-shaped) before trusting the method on new/exploratory mesh.

  A narrow radius band does NOT densely fill its own bounding box even on

  NATIVE (u,v) grid, with NO remapping involved:
      band width 2.00mm -> native fill 35.4%
      band width 1.00mm -> native fill 19.0%
      band width 0.60mm -> native fill 12.5%
  Fill rate gets WORSE as the band narrows -- the opposite of what a
  resolution/sampling problem would show. This means the papyrus surface
  genuinely UNDULATES IN RADIUS by more than 2mm within what is officially
  catalogued as a single wrap -- real physical rippling, not a computation
  bug. A radius threshold is therefore not a valid way to isolate "one
  wrap" from a mesh, for EITHER exploratory grown patches or official
  segments -- it was never a sound assumption, only the multi-wrap grown
  segments happened to make the consequence visible first.

  What IS validated and reusable here: load_axis/perpendicular_frame/
  point_coords (correct scroll-relative r/theta/along for any point cloud),
  the native-grid connected-component technique (correctly separates
  physically distinct crossings using true mesh adjacency, not 3D distance
  -- this part is genuinely useful for other tasks), and the griddata-based
  interpolation utility.

  What is NOT solved: isolating "one physical wrap" from a mesh that mixes
  several. The correct approach is almost certainly continuity-based (using
  native-grid adjacency + a local discontinuity/coherence check, similar to
  the Gate C checks in the original VC3D grow pilot) rather than a global
  radius threshold -- that is real, unfinished engineering work, not a
  parameter to tune.
